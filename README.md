# CATCH
Collection of Analysis Tools for Coronal Holes aka CATCH

For best results please download and install CATCH as a SSW/IDL package. It is available by both the SSW installation
and ssw_upgrade methods
• See http://lmsal.com/solarsoft/ssw_install.html
• For more information see http://www.lmsal.com/solarsoft/ssw_packages_info.html or consult the CATCH USER GUIDE.

Catch was created in order to collect and structure coronal hole identification, extraction and analysis in a handy and fast way without the disadvantages of automatic algorithms.It enables the user to download and process EUV filtergrams (193/195 A) and line-of-sight (Los) magnetograms. It is  able  to  handle  data  from  different  spacecraft  missions  covering  the interval  from  1996  until  now.  These  are  Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell, Thompson, and Chamberlin, 2012)),  the  Solar  Terrestrial  Relations Observatory  (STEREO;  Kaiser et al.,  2008)  and  the  Solar  and  Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO; Domingo, Fleck, and Poland, 1995). The  user  can  perform  coronal hole  boundary  detection,  extraction  and  analysis  using  a  manually  adjustable  intensity  threshold.  Additionally the user can analyze the underlying photospheric magnetic field.

It features a SSW IDL Graphical User Interface (GUI) to efficently analyze coronal holes.
